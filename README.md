I am a recent fullstack graduate of the highly selective programming bootcamp known as [Makers Academy] (https://makers.tech/).

I have a BSC in Biomedical science with a background in Laboratry Analytics and  hardware field enginering. alongside my studies and my work as a Laboratory Analyst i have taken the time to equip myself with the basics of programming(Talk about how you used MATLAB during University and passions towards tech), familiriziing myself with basic web development langauges such html, CSS and Javascript working on some web developement projects.

As a recent Graduate of Makers i now , have the ability and skills to build full stack applications with the use of Javascript and Ruby. I have been trained in the processes of OOP, TDD, Pair programming and the use of agile processes. 

During my Journey at makers i have fallen even more in love with coding and i am excited to bring my passion and enthusiasm to a new role. 

## Projects 

Below lies a selection of projects using technologies that i am proud of. to see more of my projects, [please see my Github](https://github.com/Ephfullstack?tab=repositories).
